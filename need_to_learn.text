Here are the key topics you'll need to learn or refresh to successfully implement the get_next_line() project. You can search for these topics on the internet to find tutorials, examples, and explanations:

    Static Variables in C
        Search: "Static variables in C"
        Why: You'll need static variables to retain the state between function calls, especially when handling buffers.

    Reading Files in C with read()
        Search: "C read() system call example"
        Why: The read() function is used to read data from a file descriptor into a buffer in chunks.

    Memory Management in C (malloc, free)
        Search: "malloc and free in C"
        Why: You'll need to dynamically allocate memory for reading lines and handling buffers.

    String Manipulation in C
        Search: "String manipulation in C"
        Why: You'll need to work with strings, extract lines, and manage leftover characters.

    Handling Buffers in C
        Search: "Handling buffers in C"
        Why: Buffers are used to store chunks of data temporarily. Understanding how to handle buffers efficiently is key to reading files in chunks.

    File Descriptors and File Handling in C
        Search: "File descriptor and file handling in C"
        Why: You will be working with file descriptors to read from files and the standard input.

    End of File (EOF) in C
        Search: "EOF in C"
        Why: You need to know how to detect when you reach the end of a file while reading with read().

    Line Parsing and Buffer Management
        Search: "Parsing lines from a buffer in C"
        Why: Extracting full lines from a buffer and handling partial lines between function calls is a crucial part of this project.

    Error Handling in C
        Search: "Error handling in C with read and malloc"
        Why: You'll need to handle cases where reading fails or memory allocation fails.

    Using #define for Buffer Size

    Search: "C define BUFFER_SIZE for read()"
    Why: The buffer size is configurable and needs to be handled properly to optimize memory usage and performance.

These topics will give you the foundation necessary for this project. Happy learning!
